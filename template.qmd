# Setup

## The usual

As always:

1. Clone the lab repository to your computer
1. Open the lab repository in VS Code
1. Open the Julia REPL and activate, then instantiate, the lab environment
1. Make sure you can render: `quarto render template.qmd` in the terminal.
    - If you run into issues, try running `] build IJulia` in the Julia REPL (`]` enters the package manager).
    - If you still have issues, try opening up `blankfile.py`. That should trigger VS Code to give you the option to install the Python extension, which you should do. Then you should be able to open a menu in the bottom right of your screen to select which Python installation you want VS Code to use.


## Load packages

```{julia}
using CSV
using DataFrames
using DataFramesMeta
using Distributions
using Plots
using StatsPlots
using Unitful

Plots.default(; margin=5Plots.mm)
```

## Local package

```{julia}
using Revise
using HouseElevation
```

Choosing Galveston Pier 21, Texas
The guage is at 29° 18.6 N, 94° 47.6 W
https://maps.app.goo.gl/GyanSMA2fp9rkVrT9

Our building is 302 17th St, Galveston, TX 77550,
Home area as estimated by google maps: 30ftx50ft home = 1500ft^2
Home value from zillow: 247,700 (Round up to 250,000)

The home is 4.41 feet or 1.34 meters above sea level in elevation.
Looking at it on street view, the house appears to be on concrete blocks about 6 inches tall, giving it an effective height of 4.91 feet.  Round this up to 5 so that it works.

Row 98 from the data is two-story, no basement in Galveston, so we'll be using that for our depth-damage curve.  The home is on concrete blocks, so we can be confident that it doesn't have a basement.


```{julia}
#| output: false
house = let
    haz_fl_dept = CSV.read("data/haz_fl_dept.csv", DataFrame) # read in the file
    desc = "Two-story, no basement in Galveston"
    row = @rsubset(haz_fl_dept, :Column1 == 98)[1, :,] # select the row I want
    area = 1500u"ft^2"
    height_above_gauge = 5u"ft"  #Previously used 4.91, had to round up to 5 to make it work with functions
    House(
        row;
        area=area,
        height_above_gauge=height_above_gauge,
        value_usd=250_000,
    )
end
```

```{julia}
#| code-fold: true
let
    depths = uconvert.(u"ft", (-7.0u"ft"):(1.0u"inch"):(30.0u"ft"))
    damages = house.ddf.(depths) .* house.value_usd ./ 1000
    scatter(
        depths,
        damages;
        xlabel="Flood Depth",
        ylabel="Damage (Thousand USD)",
        label="$(house.description)\n($(house.source))",
        legend=:bottomright,
        size=(800, 400),
        yformatter=:plain, # prevents scientific notation
    )
end
```

Check we can get the elevation cost:
```{julia}
elevation_cost(house, 10u"ft")
```

And then plot elevation cost so we can visually make sure that it makes sense:

```{julia}
let
    elevations = 0u"ft":0.25u"ft":14u"ft"
    costs = [elevation_cost(house, eᵢ) for eᵢ in elevations]
    scatter(
        elevations,
        costs ./ 1_000;
        xlabel="Elevation",
        ylabel="Cost (Thousand USD)",
        label="$(house.description)\n($(house.source))",
        legend=:bottomright,
        size=(800, 400),
        yformatter=:plain, # prevents scientific notation
    )
end
```

Time to model sea level rise!

Read in the sea level rise data:

```{julia}
#| output: false
slr_scenarios = let
    df = CSV.read("data/slr_oddo.csv", DataFrame)
    [Oddo17SLR(a, b, c, tstar, cstar) for (a, b, c, tstar, cstar) in eachrow(df)]
end
println("There are $(length(slr_scenarios)) parameter sets")
```

Plot data to visually verify that we read it in correctly:

```{julia}
let
    years = 1900:2150
    p = plot(;
        xlabel="Year",
        ylabel="Mean sea-level (ft)\nwith respect to the year 2000",
        label="Oddo et al. (2017)",
        legend=false
    )
    for s in rand(slr_scenarios, 250)
        plot!(p, years, s.(years); color=:lightgrey, alpha=0.5, linewidth=0.5)
    end
    p
end
```
